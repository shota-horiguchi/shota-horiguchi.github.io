I am a senior researcher at [Hitachi, Ltd.](https://www.hitachi.com/) Research and Development Group. I am also enrolled in a doctoral course at the [Multimedia Laboratory](https://www.mmlab.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/english/) of [University of Tsukuba](https://www.tsukuba.ac.jp/en/), supervised by [Assoc. Prof. Takeshi Yamada](https://www.mmlab.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/~takeshi/english/).

Previously, I studied computer vision at the Aizawa-Yamasaki Laboratory (now [Aizawa-Yamakata-Matsui Laboratory](http://www.hal.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/lab/en/)) of [the University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index.html), where I received BE and ME degrees under the supervision of [Prof. Kiyoharu Aizawa](https://www.hal.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~aizawa/).
