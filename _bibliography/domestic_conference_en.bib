As a result, we discovered that a CNN with Sigmoid Layer can detect novelties in an easy dataset better than that with Softmax Layer, but worse in a difficult dataset.},

    abstract={Automatic food recognition or classification is very challenging task. One of the reason is that the number of food items is enormous, and so we can't easily choose a single label for each food image. To solve this problem, we have studied hierarchical food classification. In this paper, we investigate the benefits of introducing hierarchy to classication and try to build hierarchy from words of food names automatically. As a result, we observed the difference between data used for training.},

    abstract={When detecting objects in images by which classifying many location hypotheses, it is necessary to define aspect ratio and scale of detection window in advance. In this paper, we construct a model of size distribution of objects in images, and revealed that the size of foods in images taken for recording dietary follows a log-normal distribution. We apply this characteristic to define parameters of selective search, the method of generating object hypotheses, and result in high Mean Average Best Overlap in spite of small number of object hypotheses when using FoodLog image dataset.},
